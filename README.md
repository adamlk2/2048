  ## **2048**

As part of the course ECE 220: Computer Systems and Programmingn at UIUC, I was assigned the task to implement a game similar to the popular game 2048 in functionality. The project emphasized on the use of pointers and focused as such on memory allocation. 

*Note: I was provided with the following files: Makefile, game.h, getch_fun.c, getch_fun.h, mani.c and some parts of game.c. I implemented the code under the comment: //Your Code Starts here.
